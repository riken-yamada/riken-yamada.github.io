- We are based in beautiful Kyoto (https://kyoto.travel/en/), and close to Osaka, the second largest city in Japan.
- We are an international team: both our members and collaborators are from all over the world.
- We regularly publish papers at top ML venues, including NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, and ICLR.
