We are currently looking for start-up members for our newly created [Machine Learning and Data Science (MLDS) Unit at OIST](https://groups.oist.jp/mlds). We look forward to hearing from you soon!

# Open positions
Informaiton about the MLDS unit at OIST:

- We are part of OIST, Japanâ€™s international and interdisciplinary research institution and is very strong in natural science research. Therefore, you can not only conduct fundamental machine learning research but also research on the application of machine learning to the natural sciences (i.e., Machine Learning for Science).
- We are an international team: both our members and collaborators are from all over the world.
- We regularly publish papers at top ML venues, including NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, and ICLR.
- We are closely working with High-dimensional statistical modeling team at RIKEN AIP  and the Kashima-Yamada labs at Kyoto University. We collaborated with researchers at CMU, Oxford, and UCL. Moreover, we actively collaborated with industries, including NTT communication science laboratory, CyberAgent, Google Brain, Meta AI, and SliceX AI. 


## Researchers
We plan to hire a couple of researchers at OIST soon. So, please let us know if you are interested in the role!
