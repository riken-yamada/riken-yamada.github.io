# Research

We have two goals:

- **Machine learning for science**: Develop machine learning methods that help scientists finding new scientific discoveries.
- **Machine learning**: Develop fundamental machine learning algorithms.

### Sparse Learning
- High-dimensional nonlinear feature selection
- Matrix completion

### Selective Inference for Kernels
- Selective Independence test
- Selective two-sample test
- Selective goodness of fit test

### Optimal Transport
- OT for tree-structured data
- OT for high-dimensional data
- OT based Semantic correspondence
